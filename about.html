 <blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #e74d3b;">The way I am</span></strong><br />
 When I was 8 years old we moved from Hong Kong to UK. Not being able to speak English back then meant I became very sensitive to my surroundings, I had to read people. I also learnt to be very empathetic. I was constantly feeling helpless and misunderstood. I don&#8217;t want anyone to ever have to feel that way.</p></blockquote>
